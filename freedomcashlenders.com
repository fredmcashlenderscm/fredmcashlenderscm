Though payday loans are generally considered the easiest way to get a loan and the fastest for that matter, not all people who apply for a payday loan gets approved. The following are some of the basic reasons that people get denied when applying for these types of loans:

Most of the people who get disapproved when applying are those that don't meet or earn the minimum income required, or ones that don't have a regular job. Even the most considerate and flexible payday lenders can't afford to loan money to someone who grosses less than the minimum wage.

Getting a payday loan is more difficult to get for someone who's self employed. Most lenders don't usually accept self employed applicants for security purposes. Lenders who do usually require bank statements of previous months to verify stability of income.
